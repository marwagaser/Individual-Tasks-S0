PROJECT TITLE: Github - Sprint 0

Getting Started: In this repositry we have three files:

   1.The first file talks about version control. It ,as well, helps the reader understand why Git is around, why you should use it and you should be all set up to do so.
   2.The second file talks about switching between branches (using checkout command) and how changes do not apply to master branch as long as the commit is on another branch  
   3.The third file talks about how to work and contribute in a project with several people so that you are able to easily integrate everyone's work
